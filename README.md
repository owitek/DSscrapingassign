# Data Science Scraping Assingment
## Project A

This github repository contains all of the components to this project including an R script which documents my data scraping procedure, the raw data I that I was able to pull from the various media sources Twitter accounts, and several graphs which present my findings.

I chose to scrape tweets from the following news sources to get data from a wide range of media sources. I picked 10 media sources that gave me the most complete picture of the current media landscape and allowed for the most cross-sectional analysis. The primary differences between these organizations are ideology, geographic location, and method of delivery.  The full list of news sources appears below.

*Television

**CBS News
**MSNBC
*Newspaper/Print
**LA Times
**Boston Globe
**Weekly Standard
*Internet News
**Vox
