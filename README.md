# Data Science Scraping Assingment
## Project A

This github repository contains all of the components to this project including an R script which documents my data scraping procedure, many .csv files which include the data I was able to pull from the Twitter accounts of various media sources, and a table and several graphs that present my findings.

I chose to scrape tweets from the following news sources in order to obtain data from a wide range of media sources. I attempted to select 10 media sources that gave me the best picture of the current media landscape and allowed for the most interesting cross-sectional analysis. The primary differences between these organizations are ideology, geographic location, target audience, frequency of output, and method of delivery. The news sources are:

*  Television
   *  NBC News
   *  CBS News
   *  MSNBC
*  Newspaper/Print
   *  LA Times
   *  Boston Globe
   *  Weekly Standard
*  Internet
   *  Vox
   *  Slate
   *  Drudge Report
   *  Daily Caller

The percentage breakdowns for each news source's tweet classification are shown in Figure 1 below:
